# Introduction
Experiments in DDD and EDA concepts exposed as a small framework.

(Just ignoring the warning to never make such a thing.)

# Getting started
I would really like to know how I can apply this framework on a greenfield project.
Where do I start? What are the concepts I should know? 

## How to use
See example in [test](https://github.com/telcirion/cqrs-framework/tree/master/src/test/java/cqrs/test).
